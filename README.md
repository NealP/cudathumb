## Warning
You need an Nvidia GPU and OpenCV compiled with CUDA support for this to work. 

## Usage
`./thumbnailer [file or folder]`

You can modify the width of the thumb in the source, aspect ratio is preserved, will eventually add some CLI options. 
Runs around 2-3x faster than equivalent CPU thumbnailers.
